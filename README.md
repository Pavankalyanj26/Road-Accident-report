🚦 Road Accident Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)
A Data Analytics Project on UK Road Accident Data
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes UK road accident data to identify accident patterns, severity levels, risk conditions, and contributing factors.
The dashboard provides a full breakdown of accident counts by vehicle type, area, weather, road conditions, severity, and more.

The goal is to help stakeholders such as traffic departments, policy makers, and road safety teams gain insights into accident hotspots and risk patterns to improve safety measures.

🗂️ Dataset Information

📊 Dashboard Highlights (Visuals Included)
1️⃣ Total Cases Summary

Total Cases: 307.97K

By Vehicle: 307.16K

Slight Injuries: 263.28K

Serious Injuries: 40.74K

Fatal Cases: 3953

2️⃣ Vehicle Type Breakdown

Visual (Left Panel)

Public Transport — 15.05K

Private Vehicles — 280.56K

Goods Vehicles — 9034

Agricultural — 749

Other Vehicles — 2585

This clearly shows private vehicles contribute to the highest number of accidents.

3️⃣ Type of Area (Pie Chart)

Urban: 64.46%

Rural: 35.54%

→ Most accidents occur in urban areas, likely due to higher traffic density.

4️⃣ Accident Severity by Road Conditions (Bar Chart)

Dry Roads: 0.21M accidents

Wet / Damp: 0.08M

Frost / Ice / Snow / Flooding: Very low count

→ Majority of accidents occur in dry conditions, meaning environmental factors are not the biggest cause — human and traffic behavior likely is.

5️⃣ Light Conditions (Donut Chart)

Daylight: 73.8%

Darkness: 20.46%

→ Daylight has more accidents because traffic volume is higher.

6️⃣ Road Type Distribution (Treemap)

Single Carriageway: 230.61K

Dual Carriageway: 45.47K

Roundabout: 20.93K

Other Road Types: (Smaller values)

→ Majority of accidents occur on single carriageway roads.

7️⃣ Accident Map (UK Map)

The interactive map shows accident counts by region using location markers such as:

220

94

14

19

12
…and more.

Users can toggle Night Mode for better visibility.
